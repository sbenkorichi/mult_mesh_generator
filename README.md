# mult_mesh_generator
This is a free open source web-based Python tool to generate MULT lines based on a single MESH line.
The app can be found here : http://www.sbenkorichi.com/handy-tools/mult-mesh-generator/

For any questions or issues, just create an issue and will take a look.

Example:

IJK   = single mesh equivalent IJK, exp: 221,221,241 
XB    = single mesh equivalent XB,  exp: -1.5,1.5,-1.5,-3,3 
MBLKS = mesh block arrangment,      exp: 5,5,5
