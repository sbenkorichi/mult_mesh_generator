This is a free open source web-based Python tool to generate MULT lines based on a single MESH line.
The app can be found here : http://www.sbenkorichi.com/handy-tools/mult-mesh-generator/

For any questions or issues, just create an issue here and will take a look.

Example:

IJK   = single mesh equivalent IJK, exp: 221,221,241 

XB    = single mesh equivalent XB,  exp: -1.5,1.5,-1.5,-3,3 

MBLKS = mesh block arrangment,      exp: 5,5,5
